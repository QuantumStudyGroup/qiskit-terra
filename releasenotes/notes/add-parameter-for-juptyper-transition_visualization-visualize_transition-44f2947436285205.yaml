    No parameter exists to increase memory for large visualize_transitions
    rendering. The memory allocated for jupyterlab notebooks is hard coded
    to 50mb
features:
  - |
    a parameter was added which the user can optionally change the max size
    limit with the default raised from 50 to 100MB
    parameter added: jupyter_embed_size_limit_mb=100
fixes:
  - |
    This fixes the problem of having a hardcoded 50MB threshold for generating
    animated visualizations using the visualize_transition function from
    qiskit\visualization\transition_visualization.py file.
